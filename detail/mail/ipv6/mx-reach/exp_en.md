We check if we can connect to your mail servers (MX) over IPv6 on port 25. We test all IPv6 addresses that we receive from the name servers of your mail server domain(s). A partial score will be given if not all IPv6 addresses are reachable. If an IPv6 address is (syntactically) invalid, we consider it unreachable.
