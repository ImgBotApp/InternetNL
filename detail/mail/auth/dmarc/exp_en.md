We check whether DMARC is available for your domain. A receiving mail server may use your DMARC policy to evaluate how to handle a mail with your domain as sender that could not be authenticated with both DKIM and SPF, and it may use your mail address from the DMARC record to provide feedback reports on this to you. Currently we do not evaluate the DMARC policy. Even without an active policy DMARC can be useful to get more insight in legitimate and illegitimate outbound mail flows through DMARC reports. However in order for DMARC to be effective against abuse of your domain for phishing and spam, you need to set an active policy ('quarantaine' or 'reject'). As a quick win we recommend to set a reject policy for (sub-)domains that you do not use for sending mail to prevent abuse by others. Note: DMARC requires the SPF domain (envelope sender, i.e. return-path that shows up in "MAIL FROM") and the DKIM domain (d=) to align with the body sender ("From:").
