We check whether DMARC is avalable for your domain. Currently we do not evaluate the DMARC policy. Even without an active policy DMARC can be useful to get more insight in legitimate and illegitimate outbound mail flows through DMARC reports. However in order for DMARC to be effective against abuse of your domain for phishing and spam, you need to set an active policy ('quarantaine' or 'reject'). As a quick win we recommend to set a reject policy for (sub-)domains that you do not use for sending mail to prevent abuse by others.
