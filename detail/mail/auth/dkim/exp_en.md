We check if your domain has a DKIM record. A receiver of an email from your domain can use the public key in the DKIM record to validate the signature in the mail. Currently we are not able to evaluate if the public key in your DKIM record is valid, because we would need an email from your domain to do so. To pass this test we expect your name server to answer `NOERROR` to our 'empty non-terminal' query for `_domainkey.example.nl`. Some name servers that are not conformant withÂ RFC2308 incorrectly answer `NXDOMAIN` in stead of `NOERROR` when there is a DKIM record making it impossbile for us to detect the DKIM record.
