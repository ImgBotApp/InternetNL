We check if your domain has a SPF record. A receiving mail server can use the whitelisted IP addresses of your sending mail servers and the accompanying policy from your SPF record to determine the authenticity of a received email with your domain as sender. Currently we do not evaluate the SPF policy. In order for SPF to be effective against abuse of your domain for phishing and spam, you need to set an active policy ('soft fail' or 'hard fail').
