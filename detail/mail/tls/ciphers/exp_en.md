We check whether your receiving mail servers support sufficiently secure cipher suites. A cipher suite is a combination of algorithms used for authentication and encryption that is conformant to the TLS standard. A mail server may support more than one cipher suite. See ['TLS guidelines from NCSC-NL](https://www.ncsc.nl/actueel/whitepapers/ict-beveiligingsrichtlijnen-voor-transport-layer-security-tls.html), guideline B2-1 to B2-4 (in Dutch).
