We check if the DANE fingerprints presented by your mail server domains are valid for your mail server certificates. DANE allows you to publish information about your mail server certificates in a special DNS record, called TLSA record. Sending mail servers can check the authenticity of your certificates not only through the certificate authority but also through the TLSA records. A sending mail server can also use the TLSA record as a signal to only connect via STARTTLS (and not unencrypted). When the DANE fingerprint of a receiving mail server is checked by the sending mail server, an active attacker who is able to manipulate the mail trafic cannot strip STARTTLS encryption. DNSSEC is preconditional for DANE. Note: cases where we detect a valid TLSA record but no DNSSEC support or where we get an error while retrieving the TLSA record, are also considered failures for this test.
