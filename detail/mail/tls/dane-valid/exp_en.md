We check whether the DANE fingerprints presented by your mail server domains are valid for your mail server certificates. DANE allows you to publish information about your mail server certificates in a special DNS record, called TLSA record. Sending mail servers can check the authenticity of your certificates not only through the certificate authority but also through the TLSA records. A sending mail server can also use the TLSA record as a signal to only connect via STARTTLS (and not unencrypted). DNSSEC is preconditional for DANE. Note: cases where we detect a valid TLSA record but no DNSSEC support or where we get an error while retrieving the TLSA record, are also considered failures for this test.
