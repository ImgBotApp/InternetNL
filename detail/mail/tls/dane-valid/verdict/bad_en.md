At least one DANE fingerprint on your mail server domains is *not* valid for its mail server certificate. Either someone manipulated the response from the name server, or the mail server domains have a serious DANE configuration error. The latter makes your domain  unreachable for any sending mail server that checks DANE fingerprints. You should contact your mail provider as soon as possible.
