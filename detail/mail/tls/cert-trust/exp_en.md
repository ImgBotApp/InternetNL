We check if we are able to build a valid chain of trust for your mail server
 certificate. For a valid chain of trust, your certificate must be published
 by a [trusted certificate authority](https://www.mozilla.org/en-
US/about/governance/policies/security-group/certs/), and your receiving mail
 server must present all necessary intermediate certificates. See ['TLS 
guidelines from NCSC-NL'](https://www.ncsc.nl/actueel/whitepapers/ict-
beveiligingsrichtlijnen-voor-transport-layer-security-tls.html), guideline 
B3-6 (in Dutch).
