We check if the resolvers that you use validate the DNSSEC signatures of our domain name. Resolvers are usually provided by your internet provider. Alternatively you can configure another DNS provider. You can even use your own installed resolver. Although validation is done in the resolver, the communication from the resolver back to the end user device (referred to as the last mile) could still be tampered with. Thus the most secure way is to validate close to the end user device (e.g. use a locally installed resolver), or make sure that the channel between the resolver and the end user device is secured/trusted.
