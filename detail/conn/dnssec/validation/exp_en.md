We check if the resolvers that you use validate the DNSSEC signatures of our domain name. DNSSEC validation can take place on the DNS resolvers of your internet provider or of a different DNS provider that you use, and/or on your own local systems. The most secure way is to validate close to the end user device, because in that case a criminal is not able to secretly manipulate the DNS translation anywhere in transit.
