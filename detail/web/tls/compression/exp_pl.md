We check if your web server supports TLS compression. The use of compression
 can give an attacker insights in secret parts of encrypted communication. 
TLS compression is rarely used, so switching it off does not do any harm. 
See ['ICT security guidelines for TLS' from NCSC-
NL](https://www.ncsc.nl/actueel/whitepapers/ict-beveiligingsrichtlijnen-
voor-transport-layer-security-tls.html), guideline B6-1 (in Dutch).
