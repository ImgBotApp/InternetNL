We check if the bit-length of the public key of your website certificate is 
sufficiently secure. Note: it is also important that the bit-length of the 
secret key is sufficiently secure. However, due to its secret nature we are 
not able to check this. See ['TLS guidelines from NCSC-
NL'](https://www.ncsc.nl/actueel/whitepapers/ict-beveiligingsrichtlijnen-
voor-transport-layer-security-tls.html), guideline B3-3 to B3-5 (in Dutch).
