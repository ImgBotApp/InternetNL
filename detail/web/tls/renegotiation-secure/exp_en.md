We check if your web server offers support for secure renegotiaton only. The TLS standard allows to step out of the application phase and force a new handshake. This is called renegotiation and it was originally designed very insecurely. The standard was fixed and now allows for secure renegotiation. The old version,Â  that is called insecure renegotiation nowadays, should not be supported. See ['Security guidelines for TLS' from NCSC-NL](https://www.ncsc.nl/actueel/whitepapers/ict-beveiligingsrichtlijnen-voor-transport-layer-security-tls.html), guideline B6-1.
