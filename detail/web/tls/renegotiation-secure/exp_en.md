We check if your web server supports secure renegotiaton. The TLS standard allows to step out of the application phase and force a new handshake. This is called renegotiation. Originally this was designed very insecurely, but the standard was fixed and now allows for secure renegotiation. The old version,Â i.e. insecure renegotiation, should not be supported. See [TLS guidelines from NCSC-NL](https://www.ncsc.nl/actueel/whitepapers/ict-beveiligingsrichtlijnen-voor-transport-layer-security-tls.html), guideline B6-2.
