We check if your webserver offers support only for secure TLS versions. Recent TLS versions are more secure than older versions. The oldest TLS versions (i.e. SSL version 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0) contain unrepairable vulnerabilities and therefore should not be used. TLS 1.0 and 1.1 are sufficiently secure. The most recent version, TLS 1.2, offers the best protection. A webserver can support more than one TLS version mainly for interoperability reasons. See [Security guidelines for TLS from NCSC-NL](https://www.ncsc.nl/actueel/whitepapers/ict-beveiligingsrichtlijnen-voor-transport-layer-security-tls.html), guideline B1-1.
