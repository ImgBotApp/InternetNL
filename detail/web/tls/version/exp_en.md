We check if your web server offers support for secure TLS versions only. The oldest TLS versions (i.e. SSL version 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0) contain unrepairable vulnerabilities and therefore should not be used. TLS 1.0 and 1.1 are sufficiently secure. The most recent version, TLS 1.2, offers the best protection. A web server may offer support for more than one TLS version. See ['ICT security guidelines for TLS' from NCSC-NL](https://www.ncsc.nl/actueel/whitepapers/ict-beveiligingsrichtlijnen-voor-transport-layer-security-tls.html), guideline B1-1.
