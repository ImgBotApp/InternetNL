We check if your webserver offers support for secure TLS versions only. Recent TLS versions are more secure than older versions. The oldest TLS versions (i.e. SSL version 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0) contain unrepairable vulnerabilities and therefore should not be used. TLS 1.0 and 1.1 are sufficiently secure. The most recent version, TLS 1.2, offers the best protection. A webserver may offer support for more than one TLS version. See ['Security guidelines for TLS' from NCSC-NL](https://www.ncsc.nl/actueel/whitepapers/ict-beveiligingsrichtlijnen-voor-transport-layer-security-tls.html), guideline B1-1.
