We check if your web server supports secure TLS versions only. The oldest 
TLS versions (i.e. SSL 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0) contain severe vulnerabilities. 
Therefore they should not be used. TLS 1.0 and 1.1 are sufficiently secure. 
The most recent version, TLS 1.2, offers the best protection. A web server 
may support more than one TLS version. See ['TLS guidelines from NCSC-
NL'](https://www.ncsc.nl/actueel/whitepapers/ict-beveiligingsrichtlijnen-voor-transport-layer-security-tls.html), guideline B1-1 (in Dutch).
