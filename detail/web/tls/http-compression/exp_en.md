We test if your web server supports HTTP compression. Compression can give an attacker insights in secret parts of encrypted communication. Make your own assessment on using HTTP compression. If you use it, check if it is possible to take countermeasures on theÂ  application level against the attack vector. See [TLS guidelines from NCSC-NL](https://www.ncsc.nl/actueel/whitepapers/ict-beveiligingsrichtlijnen-voor-transport-layer-security-tls.html), guideline B6-1.
