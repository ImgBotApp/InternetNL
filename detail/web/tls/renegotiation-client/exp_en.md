We check if a client (usually a web browser) can initiate a renegotiation with your web server. There seems to be no need to support client-initiated renegotiation. Although the option does not bear a risk for confidentiality, it does make a web server vulnerable to  DDoS attacks. Therefore you should not support it. See ['TLS guidelines from NCSC-NL'](https://www.ncsc.nl/actueel/whitepapers/ict-beveiligingsrichtlijnen-voor-transport-layer-security-tls.html), guideline B6-2 (in Dutch).
