We check if your web server supports HSTS. HSTS forces a web browser to connect directly via HTTPS when revisiting your website. This helps preventing man-in-the-middle attacks. A common retention time duration for the HSTS policy is 6 months to one year. A long period is beneficial because it also protects infrequent visistors. However if you want to stop supporting HTTPS, you will have to wait longer until the validity of the HSTS policy in all browsers that vistited your website, has expired.
