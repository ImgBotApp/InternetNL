We check if your web server supports HSTS. By supporting HSTS, a web browser will force itself to connect via HTTPS when revisiting your website. This helps preventing man-in-the-middle attacks. A common retention time duration for the HSTS policy is 6 months to one year. A longer period is beneficial to protect infrequent visistors. However if you want to stop supporting HTTPS, you will have to wait longer untill the age of the HSTS policy has expired.
