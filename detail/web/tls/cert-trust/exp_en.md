We check if we are able to build a valid chain of trust for your website certificate. For a valid chain of trust, your certificate must be published by a [trusted certificate authority](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/security-group/certs/), and your web server must present all necessary intermediate certificates. See ['TLS guidelines from NCSC-NL'](https://www.ncsc.nl/actueel/whitepapers/ict-beveiligingsrichtlijnen-voor-transport-layer-security-tls.html), guideline B3-6 (in Dutch).
