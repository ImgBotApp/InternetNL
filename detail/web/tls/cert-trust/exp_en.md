We check whether we are able to build a valid chain of trust for the website certificate. For a valid chain of trust, the presented certificate must be published by a [trusted certificate authority](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/security-group/certs/), and the web server must present all necessary intermediate certificates.
