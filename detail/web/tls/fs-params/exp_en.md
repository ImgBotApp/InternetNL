We check whether the bit-length of the public parameters used in Diffie-Hellman key exchange is sufficiently secure. Note: it is also important that the bit-length of the secret Diffie-Hellman key is sufficiently secure. However, due to its secret nature we are not able to check this. See ['TLS guidelines from NCSC-NL'](https://www.ncsc.nl/actueel/whitepapers/ict-beveiligingsrichtlijnen-voor-transport-layer-security-tls.html), guidelines B4-1 to B4-3 (in Dutch).
