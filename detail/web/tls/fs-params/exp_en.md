We check if the bit-length of the public parameters used in Diffie-Hellman key exchange by your web server is sufficiently secure. It is also important that the bit-length of the secret Diffie-Hellman key is sufficiently secure. However, due to its secret nature we are not able to check this. Besides Diffie-Hellman, RSA (that can be used for certificate verification as well) is secure to use for key exchange. The RSA public parameters are tested in the subtest "Public key of certificate". See ['TLS guidelines from NCSC-NL'](https://www.ncsc.nl/actueel/whitepapers/ict-beveiligingsrichtlijnen-voor-transport-layer-security-tls.html), guidelines B4-1 to B4-3 (in Dutch).
