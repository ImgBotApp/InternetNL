We check if your web server supports sufficiently secure cipher suites only. TLS uses crypotographic algoritmes for four different purposes: Certificate verification, Key exchange, Bulk encryption and Hashing. A combination of algoritmes that is conformant to the TLS standard is called a cipher suite. A web server may support more than one cipher suite. See ['TLS guidelines from NCSC-NL](https://www.ncsc.nl/actueel/whitepapers/ict-beveiligingsrichtlijnen-voor-transport-layer-security-tls.html), guideline B2-1 to B2-4.
