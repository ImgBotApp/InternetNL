We check if your web server supports sufficiently secure cipher suites only.
 A cipher suite is a combination of algorithms used for authentication and 
encryption that is conformant to the TLS standard. A web server may support 
more than one cipher suite. See ['TLS guidelines from NCSC-
NL](https://www.ncsc.nl/actueel/whitepapers/ict-beveiligingsrichtlijnen-
voor-transport-layer-security-tls.html), guideline B2-1 to B2-4 (in Dutch).
