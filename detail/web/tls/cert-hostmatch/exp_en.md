We check whether the domain name of your website matches the domain name on the certificate. It could be useful to include more than one domain (e.g. the domain with and without www) as Subject Alternative Name on the certificate. See ['TLS guidelines from NCSC-NL'](https://www.ncsc.nl/actueel/whitepapers/ict-beveiligingsrichtlijnen-voor-transport-layer-security-tls.html), guideline B3-1 (in Dutch).
