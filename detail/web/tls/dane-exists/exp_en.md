We check whether the name servers of your domain contain a TLSA record for DANE. DANE allows you to publish information about your website certificate in a special DNS record, called TLSA record. Clients, like web browsers, can check the authenticity of your certificate not only through a certificate authority but also through the TLSA record. DNSSEC is preconditional for DANE. Note: the validity of DANE-fingerprint is part of the next subtest.
