We check whether the name servers of your domain contain a TLSA record for DANE. DANE allows you to publish information about your website certificate in a special DNS record, called TLSA record. Clients, like web browsers, can check the authenticity of the certificate not only through the certificate authority but als through the TLSA record. DNSSEC is preconditional for DANE. Note: the validity of DANE is not part of this subtest, but part of the next subtest.
