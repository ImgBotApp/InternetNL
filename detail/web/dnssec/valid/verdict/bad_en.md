Your domain is 'bogus', because the DNSSEC signature is *not* valid. Either someone manipulated the response from your name server, or your domain has a *serious DNSSEC configuration error*. The latter makes your domain unreachable for any user who validates DNSSEC signatures. You should contact your name server operator (often your registrar or hosting provider) as soon as possible.
