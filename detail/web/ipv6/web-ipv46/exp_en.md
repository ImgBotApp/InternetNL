We compare the web content that we receive from your web server over both 
IPv6 and IPv4 on any available ports (80 and/or 443). In case there are 
multiple IPv6 and IPv4 addresses, we pick one IPv6 address and one IPv4 
address. If the content difference is not higher than 10%, we expect the 
main web content to be the same. Therefore websites with small differences 
(for example due to changing ads) will pass this subtest as well.
