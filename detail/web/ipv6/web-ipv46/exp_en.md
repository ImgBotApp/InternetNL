We compare the web content that we receive from your web server over both IPv6 and IPv4 on port 80 or 443. In case there are multiple IPv6 and IPv4 addresses, we pick one IPv6 address and one IPv4 address. If the content difference is not higher than 10%, we expect the main web content to be the same. Therefore websites with small intended differences (for example due to changing ads or an "reached over IPv6" notification) will pass this subtest as well.
