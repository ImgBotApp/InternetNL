We check if we can connect to your web server(s) over IPv6 on any available ports (80 and/our 443). We test all IPv6 addresses that we receive from your name servers. A partial score will be given if not all IPv6 addresses are reachable. If an IPv6 address is (syntactically) invalid, we consider it unreachable.
