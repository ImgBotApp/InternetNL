We check if we can connect to your web server over IPv6 on any available ports (80 and/our 443). We test all AAAA records that your name servers provided to us. A partial score will be given if not all the IPv6 addresses are reachable. If an AAAA record is (syntactically) invalid, we consider it unreachable.
