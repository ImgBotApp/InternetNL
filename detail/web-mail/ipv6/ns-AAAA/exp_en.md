We check if your domain name has at least two name servers for which an AAAA record with IPv6 address is defined on both their own domain names. This is consistent with te requirement that SIDN (.nl registry) sets regarding that each .nl domain must have at least two name servers (see: ["Technical requiremners for the registration of .nl domain names"](https://www.sidn.nl/downloads/terms-and-conditions/Technical%20requirements%20for%20the%20registration%20of%20nl%20domain%20names.pdf), version 25 May 2010).
