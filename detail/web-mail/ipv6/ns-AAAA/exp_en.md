We check if your domain name has at least two name servers for which an AAAA record with IPv6 address is available. This is consistent with the [technical requirement of SIDN](https://www.sidn.nl/downloads/terms-and-conditions/Technical%20requirements%20for%20the%20registration%20of%20nl%20domain%20names.pdf) (.nl TLD registry) that each .nl domain must have at least two name servers.
