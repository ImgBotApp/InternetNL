* In the website test a visitor can test if a website supports modern internet standards. After the visitor has entered a domain name, we check if a website has a modern address (IPv6), a signed domain name (DNSSEC), and a secure connection (HTTPS). 
* After testing we show the results in the form of an overall score in percentages and a result per subtest with a detailed explanation.
* Websites with a score of 100% will be added to the [Hall of Fame](/halloffame/). 
* To be clear: the website test checks on modern internet standards that partly also contribute to a more reliable and secrure internet. But do not consider it as an all-encompassing security test for websites.
