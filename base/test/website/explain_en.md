After you enter a domain name of a website, we will test if the website offers support for the modern internet standards below.
* IPv6: reachable on modern address?
* DNSSEC: domain signed?
* HTTPS: secure connection?

## Test report
After test has finished, you are directed to a test report with an overall percentage score and with the results per subtest including detailed explanations. You can use this test report to improve your website. Usually contacting your web hoster on this will be the best next step.

If your website has a score of 100%, it will be added to the [Hall of Fame](/halloffame/). 

## Scope
To be clear: the website test checks on modern internet standards that also contribute security. However it should not be considered as an all-encompassing security test for websites.
