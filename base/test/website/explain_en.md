After the visitor has entered a domain name of a website, we test if the website offers support for the following modern internet standards:
* IPv6 (modern address);
* DNSSEC (signed domain);
* HTTPS (secure connection). 

After testing the results are displayed in the form of an overall percentage score and a result per subtest with a detailed explanation. A website owner can use this test report to improve his/her website.

Websites with a score of 100% will be added to the [Hall of Fame](/halloffame/). 

To be clear: the website test checks on modern internet standards that partly also contribute to a more reliable and secrure internet. But it should not be considered as an all-encompassing security test for websites.
