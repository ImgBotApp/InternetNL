After you have entered a domain name of a website, we test if the website offers support for the modern internet standards below.
* IPv6: reachable on modern address?
* DNSSEC: domain signed?
* HTTPS: secure connection?

After executing the tests, you are directed to a test report with an overall percentage score and the results per subtest with detailed explanations. You can use this test report to improve your website. Usually contacting your web hoster on this will be the best next step.

Websites with a score of 100% will be added to the [Hall of Fame](/halloffame/). 

To be clear: the website test checks on modern internet standards that also contribute to reliability and security. However it should not be considered as an all-encompassing security test for websites.
