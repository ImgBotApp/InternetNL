After you enter a domain name of a website, we will test if the website offers support for the modern internet standards below.

* [IPv6](/faqs/ipv6/): reachable on modern address?
* [DNSSEC](/faqs/dnssec/): domain signed?
* [HTTPS](/faqs/https/): secure connection?

## Test report
After the test is finished, you are directed to a test report with detailed explanations. The report contains an overall percentage score and results per test section and per subtest. For more information see ["Explanation of score and icons"](/faqs/report/). If your website has a score of 100%, it will be added to the [Hall of Fame](/halloffame/). 

## How to improve
You can use this test report to improve your website. Usually contacting your web hosting provider on this will be the best next step.

## Scope
The website test checks on modern internet standards that contribute to reachability and security. It should not be considered as an all-encompassing security test for websites.
