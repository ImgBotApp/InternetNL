After the you have entered a domain name of an email service, we test if the email service offers support for the modern internet standards below.

* IPv6: reachable on modern address?
* DNSSEC: domain signed?
* DMARC, DKIM and SPF: protected against phishing?
* STARTTLS and DANE: secure transport?

After executing the tests, you are directed to a test report with an overall percentage score and the results per subtest with detailed explanations. You can use this test report to improve the mail service that you use. Usually contacting your mail hoster on this will be the best next step.

To be clear: the e-mail test checks on modern internet standards that partly also contribute to reliability and security. However it should not be considered as an all-encompassing security test for e-mail.
