After you enter a domain name of an email service, we will test if the email service offers support for the modern internet standards below.

* [IPv6](/faqs/ipv6/): reachable on modern address?
* [DNSSEC](/faqs/dnssec/): domain signed?
* [DMARC, DKIM and SPF](/faqs/mailauth/): protected against phishing?
* [STARTTLS and DANE](/faqs/starttls): secure transport possible?

Note: some standards are even relevant if there are no mail servers configured for your domain. 

## Test report
After the test is finished, you are directed to a test report with detailed explanations. The report contains an overall percentage score and results per test section and per subtest. For more information see ["Explanation of score and icons on test report"](/faqs/report/). 

## How to improve
You can use this test report to improve the mail service that you use. Usually contacting your mail hoster on this will be the best next step.   

## Scope
The e-mail test checks for important modern internet standards that contribute to reachability and security. It should not be considered as an all-encompassing security test for e-mail.
