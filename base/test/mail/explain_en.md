After the visitor has entered a domain name of a mail service, we test if the mail service offers support for the following modern internet standards:

* IPv6 (modern address);
* DNSSEC (signed domain);
* DMARC, DKIM and SPF (phishing protection);
* STARTLS and DANE (secure transport).

After executing the tests, the results are displayed in the form of an overall percentage score and a result per subtest with a detailed explanation. This test report can be used by an owner to improve his/her mail service.

To be clear: the e-mail test checks on modern internet standards that partly also contribute to a more reliable and secrure internet. But it should not be considered as an all-encompassing security test for e-mail.
