After the you have entered a domain name of a mail service, we test if the mail service offers support for the modern internet standards below.

* IPv6: reachable on modern address?
* DNSSEC: domain signed?
* DMARC, DKIM and SPF: protected against phishing?
* STARTLS and DANE: secure transport?

After executing the tests, the results are displayed in the form of an overall percentage score and a result per subtest with a detailed explanation. You can use this test report to improve your mail service. Usually contacting your mailhoster on this will be the best step.

To be clear: the e-mail test checks on modern internet standards that partly also contribute to a more reliable and secrure internet. But it should not be considered as an all-encompassing security test for e-mail.
