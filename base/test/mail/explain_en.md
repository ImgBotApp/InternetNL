After the you enter a domain name of an email service, we will test if the email service offers support for the modern internet standards below.

* IPv6: reachable on modern address?
* DNSSEC: domain signed?
* DMARC, DKIM and SPF: protected against phishing?
* STARTTLS and DANE: secure transport?

## Testreport
After the test finished, you are directed to a test report with an overall percentage score and with the results per subtest including  detailed explanations. You can use this test report to improve the mail service that you use. Usually contacting your mail hoster on this will be the best next step.   

## Scope
The e-mail test checks for important modern internet standards that also contribute to security. However it should not be considered as an all-encompassing security test for e-mail.
