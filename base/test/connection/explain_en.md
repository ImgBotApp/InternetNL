After you start the connection test, we will check if your currently used internet connection offers support for the modern internet standards below.

* [IPv6](/faqs/ipv6/): are websites with modern addresses reachable for you?
* [DNSSEC](/faqs/dnssec/): are domain signatures validated for you?

## Test report
After the test is finished, you are directed to a test report with detailed explanations. The report contains an overall percentage score and results per test section and per subtest. For more information see ["Explanation of score and icons"](/faqs/report/). 

## How to improve
You can use this test report to improve your internet connection. Usually contacting your internet provider on this will be the best next step.

## Scope
The connection test checks on important modern internet standards that contribute to reachability and security. It should not be considered as an all-encompassing security test for internet connections.
