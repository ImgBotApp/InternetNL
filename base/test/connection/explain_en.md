After you start the connection test, we will check if your currently used internet connection offers support for the modern internet standards below.

* IPv6: are websites with modern addresses reachable for you?
* DNSSEC: are domain signatures validated for you?

After the test has finished, you are directed to a test report with an overall percentage score and with the results per subtest including  detailed explanations. You can use this test report to improve your internet connection. Usually contacting your internet provider on this will be the best next step.

To be clear: the connection test checks on important modern internet standards that also contribute to reliability and security. However it should not be considered as an all-encompassing security test for internet connections.
