## What is Internet.nl?

Internet.nl helps you as a user to check whether your internet is up to date.
Do your [internet connection](/connection/), [e-mail](/mail/) and
[website](/domain/) use modern internet standards? And if they don&#39;t, what
can you do about it?

## What are &quot;internet standards&quot;?

So that the Internet can send data around the world, we need international
agreements on how computers talk to one another &mdash;Â the digital
&quot;plugs and sockets&quot; that link everything together.

These agreements are called [internet standards](/standards/) or internet
protocols. Most of these standards are managed by the IETF, an international
organisation that is open to anyone who wants to join in the discussion on how
new standards should be set.

## Why is it important to be &quot;up to date&quot;?

The original internet standards go back to the 1970s and 1980s, when the
Internet had only a few hundred users and was mostly used by universities to
share scientific information.

Today the Internet has more than three billion users worldwide, and carries
many sensitive documents and high-value commercial transactions. The original
internet technologies no longer provide the security and scalability we need.

The good news is that we have modern versions of the standards that remedy
these shortcomings. The bad news is that the original, outdated standards are
still widely used.

The old standards are a risk to individual internet users, who may be
vulnerable to internet fraud, or simply find that their internet connections
don&#39;t work properly. They are also a risk to &quot;The Netherlands,
Inc.&quot; After Schiphol Airport and the Port of Rotterdam, our digital
infrastructure is the &quot;third mainport&quot; in the Netherlands. A secure,
reliable Internet is vital to the future of the Dutch economy.
