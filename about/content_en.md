## 1. What is Internet.nl?
Internet.nl helps you as a user to check whether your internet is up to date. Do your internet connection, email and website use modern and safe internet standards? And if they don't, what can you do about it?

## 2. What are internet standards?
In order to exchange data between computers around the world, we need international agreements on how computers talk to one another. It is about the digital "plugs and sockets" that link everything together. These agreements are called internet standards or internet protocols. An example is SMTP, a well-known protocol for sending email. This technical core of the internet is unvisible and unknown to most users. However it is crucial for a working internet today and in the future.

## 3. Why is it important to be up to date?
The original internet standards date from the 70s and 80s, when the number of internet users was small. Nowadays, there are more than three billion users worldwide! We also use the internet more and more for transactions that are privacy-sensitive and costly. The old standards cannot meet this scale nor the modern safety requirements. For instance, we know today that you can easily spoof the sender address with the SMTP protocol. This means that we have to start using new, smarter standards. The good news is that these modern standards are available.

## 4. Are the Netherlands taking the lead in using the new standards?
Unfortunately, that is not the case. Even in a modern country like the Netherlands we use too many outdated standards that fall short of reliability. This is a risk for the individual internet user, but also for the Dutch economy. Therefore, help us improving the internet and make sure that you use modern internet standards.

## 5. Who is responsible for the new internet standards?
Our access, hosting and email providers should take care of implementing the new internet standards and setting them correctly. The more signals we send out to these providers about this, the better. Therefore it is important that you take the test here on Internet.nl and check your internet connection, email and website. Do the test results show any shortcomings? Then please send a message about this to your provider(s). If you use your own webserver or mailserver, you have to take care of the correct settings yourself.

## 6. Why don’t you address the access, hosting and email providers directly?
We do. Still it is a great help when internet users send out signals to their provider(s) as well. This may come as a surprise, but in a modern country like the Netherlands we still use many standards that are outdated and lack reliability. Therefore please help us to improve the Internet in the Netherlands.

## 7. Who are behind the Internet Standards Platform?
