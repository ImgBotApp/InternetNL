**Today (June 27, 2016) the Dutch Internet Standard PLatform launches a new 
version of the website [Internet.nl](/). From now on, 'HSTS' and 'enforced 
HTTPS' are part of the score of the website test. This was already announced
 at the [previous release](/news/nieuwe-versie-internetnl-met-aanvullingen-
https-test/). In addition to this change, the new version of 
[Internet.nl](/) includes several improvements that make testing faster and 
more stable.**
