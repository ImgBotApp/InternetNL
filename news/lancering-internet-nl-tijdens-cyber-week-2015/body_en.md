The Internet belongs to all of us and is heavily used every day by
entrepreneurs, governments and citizens. To most people, the Internet has now
become indispensable. The technical fundament of the Internet, however, is
completely invisible and unknown to most of its users. As a consequence,
modern, secure internet standards are often implemented too late or not at
all. That&#39;s the context in which the Internet Standards Platform was
founded and the Internet.nl website was launched.

## Internet.nl 

Through Internet.nl, visitors can easily and automatically check whether their
internet connection, e-mail and websites support modern, secure internet
standards. If one or more standards are not up to date, the user gets guidance
on how to improve this. Currently, the portal covers the following
standards:

- IPv6: an extended, modern range of internet addresses;
- DNSSEC: security extensions for domain names;
- TLS: secured connections;
- DKIM, SPF and DMARC: anti-phishing and anti-spoofing.

The current website is the first public release. The Platform will continue to
improve and extend the website. Feedback is appreciated.

## Dutch Internet Standards Platform

The Internet Standards Platform aims to increase the usage of modern and
secure internet standards in order to make the Internet more reliable for
everyone. The organisations participating in the Internet Standards Platform
are: the Dutch Hosting Provider Association (DHPA), ECP,
Standardisation Forum, Internet Society international, Internet Society
Netherlands, the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs, the National Cyber
Security Centre (NCSC), NLnet, RIPE NCC, SIDN, and SURFnet.
