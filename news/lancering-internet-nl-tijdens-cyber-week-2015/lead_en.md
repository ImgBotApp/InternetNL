During the Dutch Cyber Week 2015 the website Internet.nl was launched by the
Internet Standards Platform, a collaboration among organisations from the
Internet community and the Dutch government. On this website, visitors can
check whether their Internet is up to date. Are your internet connection,
e-mail and website actually using modern, secure internet standards? And if
not, what can you do about it?
