The Internet, as a global system, is a network-of-networks held together by a
spirit of collaboration. When information traverses the Internet it may pass
through a handful of networks, and the network from which the traffic
originated probably has no formal relationship with the network that receives
it. The reason why that works is collaboration, both in exchanging and
carrying traffic from other networks, and in solving problems that may have
originated several hops away.
