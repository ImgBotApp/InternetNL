This is the first public release of the Internet.nl portal. We happily receive
feedback from you on its functionality and operation.

If you have a question about the [internet standards](/standards/) promoted
here, the [Internet.nl portal](/about/) itself or the
[organisations](/partners/) supporting this platform, you most likely will
find an answer in the &quot;Frequently Asked Questions&quot; section or on one
of the other pages:

- [IPv6](/faqs/ipv6/)
- [DNSSEC](/faqs/dnssec/)
- [TLS](/faqs/tls/)
- [DKIM, SPF and DMARC](/faqs/mail/)
 &nbsp;  
- [Internet standards](/standards/)
- [About Internet.nl](/about/)
- [Partners](/partners/)

If you have a question on safe internet use in general, you should visit this
site:

- [Veilig internetten](https://veiliginternetten.nl/)

And if you didn&#39;t get the 100% score for one of the tests, you should
first contact your internet or hosting provider, or the network administrator.
The test results provide additional information to our findings and also whom
in general you should ask to resolve any issues.

If you still can&#39;t find an answer to your question, you are welcome to
contact the Internet Standards Platform:
