## General

### What is TLS?

TLS is a standard for the cryptographic protection of internet connections.
Most people have seen TLS, and its predecessor SSL, in action in their web
browsers: by specifying the &#39;https&#39; protocol in an internet
destination &mdash; for example https://www.example.com/ &mdash; an internet
user indicates that he wants to visit a website using a secure connection. The
&quot;padlock&quot; icon in the browser shows that a secure connection was
established successfully, and optionally provides more detailed security
information.

Unfortunately, just enabling TLS does not guarantee security: it needs to be
properly configured as well. Using older versions and outdated security
options can still make a TLS connection insecure. The Dutch National Cyber
Security Centre ([NCSC](/partners/#NCSC)) has published a guide on how to use
TLS properly. This guide forms the basis of the information and tests provided
on this site.
