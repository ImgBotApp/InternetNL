## General

### What is IPv6?

The Internet Protocol (IP) is the technology underlying all traffic on the
Internet. Under the current standard, IP version 4 (IPv4), every computer has
a specific IP address made up of four numbers, such as 192.0.2.26. That is how
every computer connected to the Internet is reachable from any other computer.

IPv4 is now 35 years old and is reaching its limits. The biggest problem is
that IPv4 can only support four billion IP different addresses. That seems a
lot, but it isn&#39;t enough for a world of seven billion people, especially
when you think that every connected device &mdash; desktop computers, laptops,
mobile phones, webcams, central heating controllers &mdash; needs its own IP
address.

IP version 6 (IPv6), the successor to IPv4, solves the address shortage. Yet
although IPv6 is over fifteen years old now, it has not yet been widely
implemented. The problem is that most providers and businesses currently do
not offer IPv6 to their customers and users. An important goal of this site is
to change that.
