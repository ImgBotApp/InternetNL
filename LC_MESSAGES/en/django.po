msgstr "# About Internet.nl\n"
"\n"
"## 1. What is Internet.nl?\n"
"Internet.nl helps you to check whether your internet is up to date. Do your [website](/test-site/), [email](/test-mail) and [internet connection](/test-connection/) use **modern and reliable internet standards**? And if they don't, what can you do about it?\n"
"\n"
"## 2. What are internet standards?\n"
"In order to exchange data between computers around the world, we need international agreements on how computers talk to one another. The digital \"plugs and sockets\" that link everything together, so to speak. These agreements are called internet standards or internet protocols. An example is SMTP, a well-known protocol for sending email. This technical core of the internet is unvisible and unknown to most users. However it is crucial for a working internet today and in the future.\n"
"\n"
"## 3. Why is it important to be up to date?\n"
"The original internet standards date from the 70s and 80s, when the number of internet users was small. Nowadays, there are more than three billion users worldwide! And these people use the internet more and more for transactions that are privacy-sensitive and costly. The old standards cannot meet this scale nor the modern safety requirements. For instance, criminals are abusing the SMTP standard to  spoof the sender address of an email. This means that we have to start using new, smarter standards that keep our internet reliable. The good news is that these modern standards are available.\n"
"\n"
"## 4. Are the Netherlands taking the lead in using modern internet standards?\n"
"Unfortunately, that is not the case. Even in a modern country like the Netherlands (that became the first internet connected European country in 1988) we use too many outdated standards that fall short of reliability. Not using these modern standards is a risk for the individual internet user, but also for the Dutch economy and for the world at large. Therefore, please help improving the internet and make sure that you use modern internet standards.\n"
"\n"
"## 5. Who should act on modern internet standards?\n"
"Our access, hosting and email providers should take care of implementing modern internet standards and setting them correctly. Do the test results show any shortcomings? Then please send a message about this to your provider(s). If you use your own connection, webserver or mailserver, you have to take care of the correct settings yourself.\n"
"\n"
"## 6. Why don’t you address the access, hosting and email providers directly?\n"
"We do. Still it is important that internet users are aware themselves and send out signals to their provider(s) as well. This may come as a surprise, but in a modern country like the Netherlands we still use many standards that are outdated and lack reliability. Therefore please help us to improve the internet together, and demand modern internet standards.\n"
"\n"
"## 7. Who is behind Internet.nl?\n"
"The website Internet.nl is an initiative of the Dutch **Internet Standards Platform**. In this platform the below partners from the internet community and the Dutch government collaborate.\n"

"through sharing know-how and experience, both voluntary and professionally.\n"
"\n"

"visibility. Deploying these internet technologies is like installing new\n"
"plumbing: something has improved, but the water still tastes the same. Leaders\n"
"who want to inspire their colleagues to follow suit will have to provide some\n"
"visibility into what their innovations brings.\n"
"\n"
"A profound example is the Internet.nl initiative (to be launched soon), in\n"
"which the Dutch Internet community, a ministry, and a governmental agency have\n"
"collaborated to set up a website that helps to highlight the status of\n"
"deployment of key internet technology. The website gives users simple and\n"
"straightforward information about their own access to various innovative\n"
"technologies.\n"
"\n"
"Some of these technologies contribute to the continued scalability of the\n"
"Internet (IPv6 support and transparency of the network), while some relate to\n"
"security (DNSSEC, anti-spam and anti-phishing, and support for encryption). By\n"
"doing so, the site helps to promote the open standards that will make the\n"
"Internet more scalable and more secure. It highlights the leaders, and\n"
"provides the followers with tools and know-how."

"## Generic\n"
"* The ability to choose a different language from a dropdown menu. Visitors will get the equivalent page in the selected language (if available).\n"
"* The requirement that all name servers must be available over IPv6 has been cancelled. It is sufficient if at least as many name servers are available over IPv6 as there are over IPv4. This applies to both the webite test and the mail test.\n"
"\n"
"## Connection test\n"
"* The detection of the internet provider is more precise and timeouts occur less frequent. \n"
"\n"
"## Website test\n"
"* The test checks whether a HSTS-policy is available. Through HSTS a web browser will 'know' after the first visit that a website can only be accessed through a secure connection (HTTPS, not HTTP). This can prevent so-called man-in-the-middle attacks, e.g. when using public Wi-Fi. In case of deviations, the message is no longer 'orange' but 'red'.\n"
"* The test now checks whether the website enforces HTTPS by using a server redirect (301 or 302) or by applying only HTTPS (and no HTTP). In case of deviations, the message is no longer 'orange' but 'red'.\n"
"* In the case of some websites, the TLS results incorrectly showed that 'client-initiated renegotiation' was allowed. This has been solved.\n"
"* In the test results of websites with a redirect from IPv6/IPv4 to IPv4-only, the HSTS-policy over IPv6 remained incorrectly undetected. This has been solved.\n"
"* The test now checks whether actual HTTP traffic is sent over port 443. If that is not the case, the test will no longer draw incorrect conclusions which are HTTPS-related .\n"
"\n"
"## Mail test\n"
"* If Internet.nl cannot establish a connection to a mail server (e.g. by 'rate limiting'), visitors will now be asked to try again later.\n"
"* Thanks to the improved adjustment of timeouts, failure of the test part 'STARTTLS' is less likely. Therefore certain mail servers can now be tested without problems.\n"
"* Running connections serially and minimizing the number of connections should help to reduce the risk of 'rate limiting' of mail servers. Therefore certain mail servers can now be tested which was not possible before.\n"

msgstr "Below we describe the major changes.\n"
"\n"
"* The previous version of Internet.nl did test the **security of the HTTPS configuration over either IPv6 or IPv4**. Through manual testing we regularly see websites that have unintended different HTTPS configurations over IPv6 and IPv4. Therefore in the new release the HTTPS configuration is tested over both IPv6 and IPv4. **From now on** the result of this test item  is part of the overall score in the website test.\n"
"* The website tests checks whether a **HSTS policy** is published. Through HSTS a web browser gets informed after the first usage that a website only may be visited over HTTPS. This can prevent so-called man-in-the-middle attacks (for example when a public Wi-Fi hotspot is used). The result of this test item is displayed as an orange warning in case the HSTS policy is absent. As of **July 2016** the result will be part of the score in the website test.\n"
"* The website test does test whether **HTTPS is enforced** for a website. There are two ways to enforce HTTPS that are described below.The result of this test item is displayed as an orange warning in case the HSTS policy is absent. As of **July 2016** the result will be part of the score in the website test.\n"
"   1. By redirecting HTTPS to HTTPS. This can be done by redirecting `https://example.nl` to `https://example.nl`.  It is important that both domain names are identical because a web browser does only accept a HSTS policy for a certain domain when a HTTPS connection is used. If `http://example.nl` redirects to `https://www.example.nl` then a HSTS policy normally will not be used by the browser, unless a user explicitly enters `https://example.nl` or clicks on a hyperlink with this URL.\n"
"   2. By only supporting HTTPS and no HTTP. Because a browser normally uses a HTTP-connection after a user enters a domain name, users should enter `https://example.nl` to reach the website or click on a hyperlink with this URL.\n"
"* The website test does check whether **HTTP compression** is used. Enabling HTTP compression does make many websites  vulnerable for BREACH when no other mitigating measures are in place. Switching off HTTP compression could negatively impact performance. In case HTTP compression is detected an **orange warning** is displayed.\n"
"* The website test of the previous version of Internet.nl already checked whether the **content of a website was similar over IPv6 and IPv4**. The test took into account legitimate differences for example caused by different add banners. The result of this test item **from now on** is part of the overall score in the website test. \n"
"* If a user does enter a **non-existing domain name** a red error message is displayed. \n"
