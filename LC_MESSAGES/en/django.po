"through a handful of networks, and the network from which the traffic\n"
"originated probably has no formal relationship with the network that receives\n"

msgstr "# Internet standards\n"
"\n"
"The [Internet Standards Platform](/about/) is initially promoting six modern\n"
"standards for scalable and secure internet use:\n"
"\n"
"- [IPv6](#ipv6): an extended, modern range of internet addresses\n"
"- [DNSSEC](#dnssec): security extensions for domain names\n"
"- [TLS](#tls): secured connections\n"
"- [DKIM, SPF and DMARC](#dkim-spf-and-dmarc): anti-phishing and anti-spoofing\n"
"\n"
"All of these internet standards are mature and widely available. Their use\n"
"contributes significantly to the reliability of the Dutch Internet.\n"
"\n"
"[IPv6](/faqs/ipv6/), [DNSSEC](/faqs/dnssec/), [TLS](/faqs/tls/), and\n"
"[DKIM](/faqs/mail/#DKIM) have been on the\n"
"[&quot;apply or explain&quot; list](https://www.forumstandaardisatie.nl/ptolu)\n"
"of the [Standardisation Forum](/partners/#FS) for years. The standards on this\n"
"list are mandatory for Dutch public agencies.\n"
"\n"
"Until the end of 2014, IPv6 was the separate responsibility of the\n"
"[IPv6 Task Force](https://ecp.nl/ipv6-task-force), run by\n"
"[ECP](/partners/#ECP). The Task Force will soon become part of the Internet\n"
"Standards Platform.\n"
"\n"
"[SIDN](/partners/#SIDN), the registry for the .nl domain, encourages the use\n"
"of [DNSSEC](http://dnssec.nl/).\n"
"\n"
"## IPv6\n"
"\n"
"The Internet Protocol (IP) is the technology underlying all traffic on the\n"
"Internet. Under the current standard, IP version 4 (IPv4), every computer has\n"
"a specific IP address made up of four numbers, such as 192.0.2.26. That is how\n"
"every computer connected to the Internet is reachable from any other computer.\n"
"\n"
"IPv4 is now 35 years old and is reaching its limits. The biggest problem is\n"
"that IPv4 can only support four billion IP different addresses. That seems a\n"
"lot, but it isn&#39;t enough for a world of seven billion people, especially\n"
"when you think that every connected device &mdash; desktop computers, laptops,\n"
"mobile phones, webcams, central heating controllers &mdash; needs its own IP\n"
"address.\n"
"\n"
"IP version 6 (IPv6), the successor to IPv4, solves the address shortage. Yet\n"
"although IPv6 is over fifteen years old now, it has not yet been widely\n"
"implemented. The problem is that most providers and businesses currently do\n"
"not offer IPv6 to their customers and users. An important goal of this site is\n"
"to change that.\n"
"\n"
"You can find more information on IPv6 in the\n"
"&quot;[Frequently Asked Questions](/faqs/ipv6/)&quot;.\n"
"\n"
"## DNSSEC\n"
"\n"
"DNSSEC is a security system for [DNS](/faqs/dnssec/#DNS), the internet\n"
"directory that handles the translation of\n"
"[domain names](/faqs/dnssec/#DomainName) to\n"
"[IP addresses](/faqs/ipv6/#IPaddress). DNS itself works fine, but the\n"
"translation of a domain name to an IP address is not protected. That is a\n"
"security risk, because attackers can get hold of passwords or other sensitive\n"
"information by redirecting network traffic to a false IP address.\n"
"\n"
"DNSSEC extends DNS with an additional security feature: a digital signature\n"
"that guarantees the translation of a domain name to the correct IP address.\n"
"Any internet user can check that signature automatically, and so avoid being\n"
"redirected to a false IP address.\n"
"\n"
"You can find more information on DNSSEC in the\n"
"&quot;[Frequently Asked Questions](/faqs/dnssec/)&quot;.\n"
"\n"
"## TLS\n"
"\n"
"TLS is a standard for the cryptographic protection of internet connections.\n"
"Most people have seen TLS, and its predecessor SSL, in action in their web\n"
"browsers: by specifying the &#39;https&#39; protocol in an internet\n"
"destination &mdash; for example https://www.example.com/ &mdash; an internet\n"
"user indicates that he wants to visit a website using a secure connection. The\n"
"&quot;padlock&quot; icon in the browser shows that a secure connection was\n"
"established successfully, and optionally provides more detailed security\n"
"information.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately, just enabling TLS does not guarantee security: it needs to be\n"
"properly configured as well. Using older versions and outdated security\n"
"options can still make a TLS connection insecure. The Dutch National Cyber\n"
"Security Centre ([NCSC](/partners/#NCSC)) has published a guide on how to use\n"
"TLS properly. This guide forms the basis of the information and tests provided\n"
"on this site.\n"
"\n"
"You can find more information on TLS in the\n"
"&quot;[Frequently Asked Questions](/faqs/tls/)&quot;.\n"
"\n"
"## DKIM, SPF and DMARC\n"
"\n"
"DKIM, SPF and DMARC are three internet standards to fight phishing, spam,\n"
"viruses and other nasties that are delivered by [e-mail](/faqs/mail/). These\n"
"three standards are usually used together to validate the sender (a mail\n"
"address) and the sending system (a computer) of a mail message, and to verify\n"
"that the content of the message has not been altered in transit.\n"
"\n"
"All three standards use the [DNS system](/faqs/dnssec/#DNS) to publish\n"
"information online. Although the standards do not require the use of\n"
"[DNSSEC](/faqs/dnssec/) &mdash; a security system for DNS &mdash; we do\n"
"recommend its use wholeheartedly.\n"
"\n"
"### DKIM\n"
"\n"
"DKIM secures the integrity of mail messages. It safeguards both the content\n"
"and the &quot;envelope&quot; of every outgoing message with a digital\n"
"signature. This stops attackers sending messages that pretent to be from other\n"
"people (spoofing) or altering the content of a message while it is in transit.\n"
"\n"
"### SPF\n"
"\n"
"SPF prevents &quot;electronic mailboxes&quot; from accepting messages\n"
"delivered by unauthorised computer systems. Only messages from systems which\n"
"are actually allowed to send messages for a specific\n"
"[domain](/faqs/dnssec/#DomainName) will get through. To make this possible, a\n"
"list of valid senders is published online through the\n"
"[DNS system](/faqs/dnssec/#DNS). Receiving systems can use this list to\n"
"validate the sender before accepting a message.\n"
"\n"
"### DMARC\n"
"\n"
"DMARC complements the other two security standards for [e-mail](/faqs/mail/),\n"
"[DKIM](/faqs/mail/#DKIM) and [SPF](/faqs/mail/#SPF). DMARC gives\n"
"&quot;electronic mailboxes&quot; a hint on how to handle incoming mail\n"
"messages that do not pass the DKIM or SPF checks. These may be discarded, for\n"
"example, or be put aside.\n"
"\n"
"The hint is published online through the [DNS system](/faqs/dnssec/#DNS). It\n"
"can additionally contain an e-mail address to which mailboxes can report\n"
"rejected messages. This gives the administrator of a specific mail domain\n"
"useful information about the delivery of both genuine and forged messages.\n"
"\n"
"You can find more information on DKIM, SPF and DMARC in the\n"
"&quot;[Frequently Asked Questions](/faqs/mail/)&quot;."

"\n"
"## What is Internet.nl?\n"
"\n"
"Internet.nl helps you as a user to check whether your internet is up to date.\n"
"Do your [internet connection](/connection/), [e-mail](/mail/) and\n"
"[website](/domain/) use modern internet standards? And if they don&#39;t, what\n"
"can you do about it?\n"
"\n"
"## What are &quot;internet standards&quot;?\n"
"\n"
"So that the Internet can send data around the world, we need international\n"
"agreements on how computers talk to one another &mdash; the digital\n"
"&quot;plugs and sockets&quot; that link everything together.\n"
"\n"
"These agreements are called [internet standards](/standards/) or internet\n"
"protocols. Most of these standards are managed by the IETF, an international\n"
"organisation that is open to anyone who wants to join in the discussion on how\n"
"new standards should be set.\n"
"\n"
"## Why is it important to be &quot;up to date&quot;?\n"
"\n"
"The original internet standards go back to the 1970s and 1980s, when the\n"
"Internet had only a few hundred users and was mostly used by universities to\n"
"share scientific information.\n"
"\n"
"Today the Internet has more than three billion users worldwide, and carries\n"
"many sensitive documents and high-value commercial transactions. The original\n"
"internet technologies no longer provide the security and scalability we need.\n"
"\n"
"The good news is that we have modern versions of the standards that remedy\n"
"these shortcomings. The bad news is that the original, outdated standards are\n"
"still widely used.\n"
"\n"
"The old standards are a risk to individual internet users, who may be\n"
"vulnerable to internet fraud, or simply find that their internet connections\n"
"don&#39;t work properly. They are also a risk to &quot;The Netherlands,\n"
"Inc.&quot; After Schiphol Airport and the Port of Rotterdam, our digital\n"
"infrastructure is the &quot;third mainport&quot; in the Netherlands. A secure,\n"
"reliable Internet is vital to the future of the Dutch economy.\n"
"\n"
"## Who is behind Internet.nl?\n"
"\n"
"Internet.nl is an initiative of the Internet Standards Platform. By\n"
"stimulating the use of modern internet standards, the Platform members aim to\n"
"make the Internet more reliable for everyone. The [organisations](/partners/)\n"
"participating in the Internet Standards Platform are:\n"
"\n"

"\n"
"### What is DNS?\n"
"\n"
"DNS is the registration system for names and their corresponding numbers on\n"
"the Internet. It&#39;s similar to a phone book.\n"
"\n"
"The names of destinations on the Internet are called domain names. An example\n"
"is www.example.com. A domain name is what you see in the address bar at the\n"
"top of your web browser when you visit a website. You also use a domain name\n"
"when you address an [e-mail](/faqs/mail/) message, for example to\n"
"john@example.com.\n"
"\n"
"Every computer on the Internet can be reached through its own unique\n"
"[IP address](/faqs/ipv6/#IPadres). Examples are 192.0.2.26\n"
"([IPv4](/faqs/ipv6/#IPv4)) and 2001:db8::1:26 ([IPv6](/faqs/ipv6/)). DNS, an\n"
"abbreviation of Domain Name System, is a background activity that translates\n"
"domain names into IP addresses. That is how your web browser or mail message\n"
"reaches its correct destination.\n"
"\n"
"### What is DNSSEC?\n"
"\n"
"DNSSEC is a security system for [DNS](/faqs/dnssec/#DNS). DNS itself works\n"
"fine, but the translation of a domain name to an IP address is not protected.\n"
"That is a security risk, because attackers can get hold of passwords or other\n"
"sensitive information by redirecting network traffic to false IP addresses.\n"
"\n"
"DNSSEC, an abbreviation of Domain Name System Security Extensions, extends DNS\n"
"by adding a security feature: a digital signature that guarantees the\n"
"translation of a domain name to the correct IP address. Any internet user can\n"
"check the signature automatically, and so avoid being redirected to a false IP\n"
"address.\n"
"\n"
"### Who is using DNSSEC?\n"
"\n"
"Currently, over 40 percent of all .nl domains have been signed with\n"
"[DNSSEC](/faqs/dnssec/#DNSSEC). Examples are digid.nl, bof.nl, postnl.nl, and\n"
"nrcnext.nl. Almost all the other top-level domains &mdash; such as .com, .net\n"
"and .org &mdash; allow subordinate domain names to be signed with DNSSEC.\n"
"\n"
"More and more organisations are also checking the validity of DNSSEC\n"
"signatures. Examples are the Dutch Central Government (RijksDNS), the\n"
"Municipality of Heerlen, internet service provider BIT, internet provider\n"
"Edutel, and Google&#39;s Public DNS. These organisation protect their users\n"
"from being redirected to false [IP addresses](/faqs/ipv6/#IPaddress).\n"
"\n"
"### What does DNSSEC protect you from?\n"
"\n"
"[DNSSEC](/faqs/dnssec/#DNSSEC) protects against attacks on the\n"
"[DNS system](/faqs/dnssec/#DNS). Without DNSSEC, attackers can get hold of\n"
"passwords or other sensitive information by redirecting network traffic to\n"
"false [IP addresses](/faqs/ipv6/#IPaddress).\n"
"\n"
"Several cases of successful attacks have been published. For example, people\n"
"using the website of a large Brazilian bank were redirected to a false IP\n"
"address. The attacker was able to accomplish this by cracking the DNS system\n"
"of an internet provider. If the bank and the provider had used DNSSEC, users\n"
"would have been protected against this attack. Most incidents, however, are\n"
"never noticed or never published in the news.\n"
"\n"
"### What is the difference between DNSSEC and TLS?\n"
"\n"
"TODO\n"
"\n"
"## For domain name holders\n"
"\n"
"### Why is DNSSEC important to me as a holder of a domain name?\n"
"\n"
"To anyone providing online services &mdash; for example, a website, a\n"
"[mail domain](/faqs/mail/) or a shop &mdash; it is crucial that visitors reach\n"
"the correct [IP address](/faqs/ipv6/#IPaddress) and that incoming mail\n"
"messages are delivered to the correct &quot;mailbox&quot;.\n"
"\n"
"In just a few minutes an attacker can set up a fake website that is an exact\n"
"copy of your site. Most visitors will never notice the difference, because\n"
"everything but the IP address is exactly the same. The same is true for fake\n"
"mailboxes. This way, attackers can get hold of passwords or other sensitive\n"
"information that should stay private. [DNSSEC](/faqs/dnssec/#DNSSEC) stops\n"
"users from being redirected to a false IP address, or having their messages\n"
"delivered to a fake mailbox.\n"
"\n"
"If you run a business, much your interaction with customers, partners and\n"
"suppliers has probably already shifted to the Internet. This has strongly\n"
"increased the importance of a well-protected digital presence. Visitors should\n"
"be able to count on the reputation of brands in the online world as well as in\n"
"traditional shops. An insecure internet service, let alone an incident,\n"
"damages the reputation of your brand as well as your business.\n"
"\n"
"### How does DNSSEC affect me as the holder of a domain name?\n"
"\n"
"[DNSSEC](/faqs/dnssec/#DNSSEC) is a &quot;transparent&quot; extension to the\n"
"existing [DNS system](/faqs/dnssec/#DNS). This means that neither the domain\n"
"name holder nor the internet user will notice any difference when DNSSEC is\n"
"installed on a domain. When the user has enabled DNSSEC too, both parties will\n"
"immediately benefit from a strong layer of security added to the DNS system. A\n"
"fake website or mailbox is simply blocked. Internet users who are not yet\n"
"using DNSSEC can still visit a signed domain name without any problems.\n"
"\n"
"### How do I check whether DNSSEC on my domain name is working well?\n"
"\n"
"This site offers a comprehensive test of [DNSSEC](/faqs/dnssec/#DNSSEC) for\n"
"domain names:\n"
"\n"
"- [DNSSEC test](/domain/)\n"
"\n"
"Filling out a domain name &mdash; for example www.example.com &mdash;\n"
"immediately shows whether DNSSEC is enabled and working well. You can use the\n"
"detailed test report to ask your DNS administrator to enable DNSSEC or to\n"
"solve any issues.\n"
"\n"
"![domain test](internet.nl-domaintest1en-600x388.png)\n"
"\n"
"### How do I protect my domain name with DNSSEC?\n"
"\n"
"Whoever manages the [DNS system](/faqs/dnssec/#DNS) for a domain name should\n"
"be able to install [DNSSEC](/faqs/dnssec/#DNSSEC). In larger organisations,\n"
"the system is most often administered by the internal IT department or an\n"
"external service provider. In smaller organisations, the DNS service is often\n"
"part of a package from a hosting provider or another service provider who has\n"
"registered the domain name on behalf of the holder.\n"
"\n"
"### Who is the DNS administrator of my domain name?\n"
"\n"
"You can use the public WHOIS domain name registration to obtain information\n"
"about your domain. Usually this information includes the domain names of the\n"
"associated [DNS systems](/faqs/dnssec/#DNS). These names often allow you to\n"
"find out who is the administrator of your domain name. For the .nl domain,\n"
"WHOIS information is provided by [SIDN](/partners/#SIDN):\n"
"\n"
"- [WHOIS domain name registration](https://www.sidn.nl/whois/)\n"
"\n"
"![SIDN Whois: internet.nl](SIDN-Whois-internet.nl-600x498.png)\n"
"\n"
"The domain names of the DNS systems for the domain name internet.nl, for\n"
"example, are ns.nlnetlabs.nl and mcvax.nlnet.nl. This information shows that\n"
"this domain name is administered by [NLnet](/partners/#NLnet), one of the\n"
"organisations participating in this project.\n"
"\n"
"This information is also part of the detailed report from the\n"
"[domain name test](/domain/) provided on this site.\n"
"\n"
"![domain test details](internet.nl-domaintest2en-600X540.png)\n"
"\n"
"### What if my DNS administrator cannot or doesn&#39;t want to help me with DNSSEC?\n"
"\n"
"If your current [DNS administrator](/faqs/dnssec/#DNS) cannot or doesn&#39;t\n"
"want to offer [DNSSEC](/faqs/dnssec/#DNSSEC), you can transfer your domain to\n"
"a DNS administrator who does. Many DNS administrators now offer DNSSEC\n"
"signing. [SIDN](/partners/#SIDN), the registry for the .nl domain, provides a\n"
"[list of parties who are able to secure .nl domain names with DNSSEC](https://www.sidn.nl/registrars/?country=&dnssec=true).\n"
"\n"
"In order to switch, the new DNS administrator needs the so-called\n"
"&quot;zone file&quot;. This file contains a list of your domain names and\n"
"associated [IP addresses](/faqs/ipv6/#IPaddress). To transfer a domain to a\n"
"new hosting provider, you will also need the &quot;transfer token&quot;. This\n"
"is a code that the current administrator gives to the legitimate holder of the\n"
"domain, that way preventing attackers from hijacking the domain. SIDN provides\n"
"[extensive information on the transfer of domain names](https://www.sidn.nl/a/nl-domeinnaam/domeinnaam-verhuizen).\n"
"\n"
"## For internet users\n"
"\n"
"### Why is DNSSEC important to me as an internet user?\n"
"\n"
"Whether you are visiting an online bank, a web shop or your company&#39;s own\n"
"network, it is crucial that the domain name you type connects you to the\n"
"correct [IP address](/faqs/ipv6/#IPaddress), and thus to the right computer\n"
"system.\n"
"\n"
"Every day, attackers tempt internet users on a massive scale to visit fake\n"
"sites. They aim to get hold of passwords and personal or business information.\n"
"This information is then used to steal money, to order goods under false\n"
"names, or to commit identity fraud or espionage. The same applies to delivery\n"
"addresses for [e-mail](/faqs/mail/). Messages often contain personal or\n"
"business information that should not end up in the wrong place.\n"
"[DNSSEC](/faqs/dnssec/#DNSSEC) &mdash; along with [TLS](/faqs/tls/) &mdash;\n"
"stops visitors from being redirected to fake websites or sending messages to\n"
"fake &quot;mailboxes&quot;.\n"
"\n"
"### How does DNSSEC affect me as an internet user?\n"
"\n"
"Normally, you will not notice anything different when you are using\n"
"[DNSSEC](/faqs/dnssec/#DNSSEC). But if the genuine holder of the domain name\n"
"is also using DNSSEC, a reference to a fake website or &quot;mailbox&quot;\n"
"will be detected by the system. Access to the fake site will be blocked, and\n"
"messages to the fake mailbox will be returned to you. DNSSEC protects you and\n"
"domain name holders through a strong cryptographic security layer on top of\n"
"the [DNS system](/faqs/dnssec/#DNSSEC).\n"
"\n"
"### As an internet user, how do I check that DNSSEC is working well?\n"
"\n"
"This site offers a comprehensive test of [DNSSEC](/faqs/dnssec/#DNSSEC) for\n"
"internet users:\n"
"\n"

"network administrator to enable DNSSEC or to solve any issues.\n"
"\n"
"![connectivity test](internet.nl-conntest2en-600x603.png)\n"
"\n"
"### Can my internet provider enable DNSSEC for me?\n"
"\n"
"Certainly. Most internet users rely on the [DNS services](/faqs/dnssec/#DNS)\n"
"of their internet providers to look up the [IP address](/faqs/ipv6/#IPaddress)\n"
"to a domain name. The provider can check the digital signature before\n"
"forwarding the IP address to the end user. For the end user, this is the\n"
"easiest and most obvious way to use DNSSEC.\n"
"\n"
"### What if my internet provider cannot or doesn&#39;t want to help me with DNSSEC?\n"
"\n"
"If your current internet provider cannot or doesn&#39;t want to offer\n"
"[DNSSEC](/faqs/dnssec/#DNSSEC), you can switch to a provider who does. These\n"
"providers are known to use DNSSEC for their [DNS services](/faqs/dnssec/#DNS):\n"

"### Are there any other ways to deploy DNSSEC?\n"
"\n"
"If switching to another internet provider is not an option, you can use a\n"
"public [DNS service](/faqs/dnssec/#DNS) that supports\n"
"[DNSSEC](/faqs/dnssec/#DNSSEC). To do so, you will have to adjust the\n"
"[IP addresses](/faqs/ipv6/#IPadres) of the DNS service on your broadband\n"
"router or your computer. These DNS service providers are known to support\n"

"Note that the providers of these free services will be able to see all your\n"
"DNS requests.\n"
"\n"
"### Can I enable DNSSEC on my own computer?\n"
"\n"
"Certainly. This option is even more secure than the ones discussed above,\n"
"because it also protects the link between your computer and the\n"
"[DNS service](/faqs/dnssec/#DNS).\n"
"\n"
"To make this possible, [NLnet Labs](/partners/#NLnetLabs) has developed free\n"

"[DNSSEC software](/faqs/dnssec/#DNSSEC) or adjust the\n"
"[IP addresses](/faqs/ipv6/IPaddress) of their\n"
"[DNS service](/faqs/dnssec/#DNS). A simpler option is to have the digital\n"
"signatures checked by their web browsers.\n"

"connections, for example for sending [e-mail](/faqs/mail/), are not checked by\n"
"this browser-specific plugin.\n"
"\n"
"### What else can DNSSEC do?\n"
"\n"
"[DNSSEC](/faqs/dnssec/#DNSSEC) adds digital signatures to all information\n"
"published through the [DNS system](/faqs/dnssec/#DNS). Currently, this\n"
"security feature is mostly used to protect the translation from domain names\n"
"to [IP addresses](/faqs/ipv6/IPaddress). We expect that in the coming years\n"
"this technology will be used to publish other information in a secure way too.\n"
"\n"
"A security option known as DANE seems likely to become the first new\n"
"application of DNSSEC. DANE allows a user to check automatically, via DNS,\n"
"that a digital certificate really belongs to a specific website or\n"
"&quot;mailbox&quot;. This technology could, for example, have prevented the\n"

"they will help to raise the level of security in the system and reinforce\n"
"confidence in the Internet. \n"
"\n"
"And therein lays the problem: there is no direct economic incentive for\n"
"individual providers to deploy some of these technologies.\n"
"\n"
"Can&#39;t their deployment be mandated then? In theory yes, but that approach\n"
"would go against one the fundamental and foundational principles of the\n"
"Internet: as an organic system, a network of autonomous networks, not built\n"
"from a global blueprint but developing in accordance with local needs and\n"
"conditions, deployment depends on voluntary agreement and collaboration.\n"
"Forcing security and scalability through global mandates may be slow, and may\n"
"have unintended side effects. It also assumes that a global consensus can be\n"
"reached on a multitude of security issues.\n"
"\n"
"The voluntary collaborative approach, combined with a continuing dialogue with\n"
"those who impact and are impacted by certain measures &mdash; the end-users,\n"
"the policy makers, and the technicians &mdash; allows more flexibility and\n"

"## &quot;The Internet way&quot;\n"
"\n"
"Accomplishing global deployment of secure, resilient, future-proof internet\n"
"technology is better done &quot;the Internet way&quot;: at the initiative of\n"
"individual actors, based on their own decisions and their own leadership; and\n"
"through sharing know-how and experience, both voluntary and professionally.\n"
"\n"
"One important aspect in getting new innovations deployed is awareness and\n"
"visibility. Deploying these internet technologies is like installing new\n"
"plumbing: something has improved, but the water still tastes the same. Leaders\n"
"who want to inspire their colleagues to follow suit will have to provide some\n"
"visibility into what their innovations brings.\n"
"\n"
"A profound example is the Internet.nl initiative (to be launched soon), in\n"
"which the Dutch Internet community, a ministry, and a governmental agency have\n"
"collaborated to set up a website that helps to highlight the status of\n"
"deployment of key internet technology. The website gives users simple and\n"
"straightforward information about their own access to various innovative\n"
"technologies.\n"
"\n"
"Some of these technologies contribute to the continued scalability of the\n"
"Internet (IPv6 support and transparency of the network), while some relate to\n"
"security (DNSSEC, anti-spam and anti-phishing, and support for encryption). By\n"
"doing so, the site helps to promote the open standards that will make the\n"
"Internet more scalable and more secure. It highlights the leaders, and\n"
"provides the followers with tools and know-how."

"\n"
"### What is IPv6?\n"
"\n"
"The Internet Protocol (IP) is the technology underlying all traffic on the\n"
"Internet. Under the current standard, IP version 4 (IPv4), every computer has\n"
"a specific IP address made up of four numbers, such as 192.0.2.26. That is how\n"
"every computer connected to the Internet is reachable from any other computer.\n"
"\n"
"IPv4 is now 35 years old and is reaching its limits. The biggest problem is\n"
"that IPv4 can only support four billion IP different addresses. That seems a\n"
"lot, but it isn&#39;t enough for a world of seven billion people, especially\n"
"when you think that every connected device &mdash; desktop computers, laptops,\n"
"mobile phones, webcams, central heating controllers &mdash; needs its own IP\n"
"address.\n"
"\n"
"IP version 6 (IPv6), the successor to IPv4, solves the address shortage. Yet\n"
"although IPv6 is over fifteen years old now, it has not yet been widely\n"
"implemented. The problem is that most providers and businesses currently do\n"
"not offer IPv6 to their customers and users. An important goal of this site is\n"
"to change that.\n"

msgid "faqs mail content"
msgstr "**This page is still a work in progress; this information will be available\n"
"soon.**\n"
"\n"
"At the bottom of this page we provide links to more information on standards\n"
"for e-mail authentication.\n"
"\n"
"## General\n"
"\n"
"### What do DKIM, SPF and DMARC do?\n"
"\n"
"DKIM, SPF and DMARC are three internet standards to fight phishing, spam,\n"
"viruses and other nasties that are delivered by e-mail. These three standards\n"
"are usually used together to validate the sender (a mail address) and the\n"
"sending system (a computer) of a mail message, and to verify that the content\n"
"of the message has not been altered in transit.\n"
"\n"
"All three standards use the [DNS system](/faqs/dnssec/#DNS) to publish\n"
"information online. Although the standards do not require the use of\n"
"[DNSSEC](/faqs/dnssec/) &mdash; a security system for DNS &mdash; we do\n"
"recommend its use wholeheartedly.\n"
"\n"
"### What is DKIM?\n"
"\n"
"DKIM secures the integrity of mail messages. It safeguards both the content\n"
"and the &quot;envelope&quot; of every outgoing message with a digital\n"
"signature. This stops attackers sending messages that pretent to be from other\n"
"people (spoofing) or altering the content of a message while it is in transit.\n"
"\n"
"### What is SPF?\n"
"\n"
"SPF prevents &quot;electronic mailboxes&quot; from accepting messages\n"
"delivered by unauthorised computer systems. Only messages from systems which\n"
"are actually allowed to send messages for a specific\n"
"[domain](/faqs/dnssec/#DomainName) will get through. To make this possible, a\n"
"list of valid senders is published online through the\n"
"[DNS system](/faqs/dnssec/#DNS). Receiving systems can use this list to\n"
"validate the sender before accepting a message.\n"
"\n"
"### What is DMARC?\n"
"\n"
"DMARC complements the other two security standards for e-mail,\n"
"[DKIM](/faqs/mail/#DKIM) and [SPF](/faqs/mail/#SPF). DMARC gives\n"
"&quot;electronic mailboxes&quot; a hint on how to handle incoming mail\n"
"messages that do not pass the DKIM or SPF checks. These may be discarded, for\n"
"example, or be put aside.\n"
"\n"
"The hint is published online through the [DNS system](/faqs/dnssec/#DNS). It\n"
"can additionally contain an e-mail address to which mailboxes can report\n"
"rejected messages. This gives the administrator of a specific mail domain\n"
"useful information about the delivery of both genuine and forged messages.\n"

"\n"
"### What is TLS?\n"
"\n"
"TLS is a standard for the cryptographic protection of internet connections.\n"
"Most people have seen TLS, and its predecessor SSL, in action in their web\n"
"browsers: by specifying the &#39;https&#39; protocol in an internet\n"
"destination &mdash; for example https://www.example.com/ &mdash; an internet\n"
"user indicates that he wants to visit a website using a secure connection. The\n"
"&quot;padlock&quot; icon in the browser shows that a secure connection was\n"
"established successfully, and optionally provides more detailed security\n"
"information.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately, just enabling TLS does not guarantee security: it needs to be\n"
"properly configured as well. Using older versions and outdated security\n"
"options can still make a TLS connection insecure. The Dutch National Cyber\n"
"Security Centre ([NCSC](/partners/#NCSC)) has published a guide on how to use\n"
"TLS properly. This guide forms the basis of the information and tests provided\n"
