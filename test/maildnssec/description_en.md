Attackers could compromise DNS, the internet directory that handles the
translation of domain names to IP addresses as well as the publication of
information related to DKIM, SPF and DMARC. DNSSEC is a security system that
adds digital signatures to information published through the DNS system.
Senders who also use DNSSEC at their side are protected from having their
messages delivered to a fake mailbox. Receiving systems using DNSSEC can be
sure that the published DKIM, SPF and DMARC information is genuine.
