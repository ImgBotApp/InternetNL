Too bad! Some or all of the domains of your email address and mail server(s) are *not* signed with a valid signature. Therefore visitors with enabled domain signature validation, are *not* able to reliably query the IP address of your receiving mail server(s).Â An attacker could secretely manipulate the IP address and divert e-mails addressed to you to his/her own mail server. You should ask your name server operator and/or your mail provider to enable DNSSEC.
