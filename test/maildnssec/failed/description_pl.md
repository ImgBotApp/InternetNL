Too bad! Some or all of your email address and mail server domains are not 
signed with a valid signature. Therefore senders with enabled domain 
signature validation, are not able to reliably query the IP address of your 
receiving mail server(s). An attacker could secretely manipulate the IP 
address and divert e-mails addressed to you to his/her own mail server. You 
should ask your name server operator and/or your mail provider to enable 
DNSSEC.
