Unfortunately, you are <strong>not</strong> using DNSSEC. You are currently
<strong>not</strong> protected from being redirected to false IP addresses.

You should ask your internet provider or network administrator to enable
DNSSEC validation or to fix the issues in its configuration. More experienced
internet users can install DNSSEC on their own systems.
