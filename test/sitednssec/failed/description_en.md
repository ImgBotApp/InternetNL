Too bad! Your domain is *not* digitally signed. Therefore visitors with enabled domain signature validation, are *not* protected against manipulated translation from your domain into rogue internet addresses. You should ask your name server operator (often your registrar and/or hosting provider) to enable DNSSEC.
