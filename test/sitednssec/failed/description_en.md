Too bad! Your domain name is *not* digitally signed. Visitors who let domain signatures validate by their providers and/or local systems, are *not* protected against manipulated translation from your domain name into rogue internet addresses. You should ask your registrar (often your hosting provider) to enable DNSSEC.
