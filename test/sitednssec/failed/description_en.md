Too bad! Your domain name is *not* digitally signed. Visitors who let heir providers and/or local systems validate domain signatures, are *not* protected against manipulated translation from your domain name into rogue internet addresses. You should ask your registrar (often your hosting provider) to enable DNSSEC.
