Attackers could compromise DNS, the internet directory that handles the 
translation of domain names to IP addresses. DNSSEC is a security system 
that adds digital signatures to information published through the DNS 
system. Visitors who also use DNSSEC at their side are protected from being 
redirected to false IP addresses.
