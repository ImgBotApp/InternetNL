Too bad! Your domain does *not* contain all authenticity marks against email forgery. Therefore receivers are *not* able to reliably seperate phishing and spam emails abusing your domain in their sender address from your authentic emails. You should ask your mail provider to activate DMARC, DKIM and SPF.
