The connection between mail servers can be secured with STARTTLS. Both the 
incoming and sending mailserver should support STARTTLS in order to set up 
an encrypted connection. This test checks whether the incoming mail server 
(MX) of the tested domain name does support STARTTLS in the right manner.
