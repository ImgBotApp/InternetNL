Good! Sending mail servers can establish a secure connection with your mail server(s). This prevents a passive attacker from being able to intercept and read e-mails addressed to you in transit. We advise to also publish DANE records to prevent active attackers from stripping the STARTTLS encryption and eavesdrop the mail trafic to your mailserver.
