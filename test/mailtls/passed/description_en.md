Well done! Sending mail servers supporting STARTTLS can establish a secure connection with your mail server(s). Passive attackers who eavesdrop the mail traffic to you, will therefore not be able to read emails in transit. Note: we additionally recommend to publish DANE records to counteract active attackers from stripping STARTTLS encryption by manipulating the mail traffic.
