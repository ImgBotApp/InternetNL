Unfortunately; this incoming mail server does <strong>not or 
insufficienly</strong> support STARTTLS. This means that sending mail 
servers can <strong>not</strong> establish a secure connection with this 
mail server which makes it vulnerable for eavesdropping attacks by (passive)
 attackers. You should ask your mail provider to enable STARTTLS and to 
configure it correctly.
