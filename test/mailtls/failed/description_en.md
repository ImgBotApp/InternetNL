Unfortunately; the incoming mail server does <strong>not or insufficienly</strong> support (START)TLS. This means that sending mail servers can <strong>not</strong> establish a secure connection with this mail server which makes it vulnerable for eavesdropping attacks by (passive) attackers. You should ask your mail provider to enable TLS and to configure it correctly.
