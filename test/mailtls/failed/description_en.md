Too bad! Sending mail servers that support STARTTLS can establish *no* or an *insufficiently* secure connection with your receiving mail server(s). Passive attackers who eavesdrop the mail traffic to you, will therefore be able to read emails in transit. You should ask your mail provider to enable STARTTLS and configure it securely. Note: we additionally recommend to publish DANE records to counteract active attackers from stripping STARTTLS encryption by manipulating the mail traffic.
